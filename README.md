## My Expectations of You and Our Working Relationship
- Proactive communication
    - Ask questions, be clear about problems, leave a paper trail
- We will practice the art of giving each other feedback
    - I really want you to be able to let me know when you're frustrated with
      something I'm doing, the team is doing, or the company is doing
    - I am always willing to give you feedback especially if you have a specific
      question
- Transparency, building from trust
    - Even to the point that I would give a shining reference for any one of you
    - I am currently very invested in our future
- Reliability and Dependability
    - Do what you say you're going to. Be around for your team. Be on time to
      meetings. Speak up as soon as you think you might not be able to.
- I find that the strongest and most fulfilling work comes from collaboration.
    - A remote first team does need to have more initiative for working together


## My Northstar Values
- Seeing people grow, learn, succeed, and find joy
- The compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things*
    - Especially powerful at a small company - each of us has an immense impact

## What You Can Expect Of Me
- Strong belief in 1:1s.
    - Occasionally travel and vacation will lead to shuffling of the schedule. I 
      will do this with some notice and am always glad to consider if you'd like 
      to propose a better time in general or as a one-off.
- All five things I listed as expectations of you above, I also expect of myself
  to always strive for excellence in them. The two I struggle with the most are 
  punctuality (I apologize in advance for my frequent 5 minutes late) and giving
  critical [feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yODalLQ2lM).


## Idiosyncrasies/Quirks/aka "I'm a human"
- I believe busy is a bug, not a feature. I know I can come across scattered 
  sometimes and I'd rather not! Thanks for encouraging me to take a breath.
- I try not to slack outside of 9-5. If I haven't left the office yet at 5pm,
  I'm probably running late. If I do send you a message outside your working
  hours, I 100% don't expect you to respond til your regular hours start back up
  again (though DevOps' "regular hours" do include some evening and weekend
  check-ins).
- You are free to contact _me_ at any time. If it's urgent, I'll respond quite 
  quickly, or as quickly as I humanly can. If I receive a message from you outside 
  of my working hours and it doesn't appear urgent, I'll follow up with you when 
  I'm back at work.
- I'm pretty obviously [yellow](https://larahogan.me/blog/leadership-style-colors/)
  and strive to be more blue.
