## Expectations
- Proactive communication
    - Ask questions, be clear about problems, leave a paper trail
- We will practice the art of giving each other feedback
    - I really want you to be able to let me know when you're frustrated with
      something I'm doing, the team is doing, or the company is doing
    - I am always willing to give you feedback especially if you have a specific
      question
- Transparency, building from trust
    - Even to the point that I would give a shining reference for any one of you
    - I am currently very invested in our future
- Reliability and Dependability
    - Do what you say you're going to. Be around for your team. Be on time to
      meetings. Speak up as soon as you think you might not be able to.
- I find that the strongest and most fulfilling work comes from collaboration.
    - A remote first team does need to have more initiative for working together


## My Northstar Values
- Seeing people grow, learn, succeed, and find joy
- The compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things*
    - Especially powerful at a small company - each of us has an immense impact


## Idiosyncrasies
- I believe busy is a bug, not a feature.
- I try not to slack outside of 9-5. If I haven't left the office yet at 5pm,
  I'm probably running late. If I do send you a message outside your working
  hours, I 100% don't expect you to respond til your regular hours start back up
  again (though DevOps' "regular hours" do include some evening and weekend
  check-ins).
